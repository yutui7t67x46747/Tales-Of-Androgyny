# Lewd RPG Game by Majalis

Hi there! This is a *lewd/erotic/adult/pornographic game* featuring characters with androgynous features—some male, some female, and some... slime?

You play as a *feminine guy that looks like a gal*, and you do lewd things with guys, gals, monster guys, monster gals, and... slimes?  

It’s a *stance-based RPG with rogue-lite elements* and a frankly suspicious number of phalluses, written, drawn, and programmed by us, the *Majalis team*, consisting of:

- Two programmers  
- One artist  
- One writer  

Making in all, two!  

This is a *custom-built game using libgdx*.

However, note that this game has *very few characters with more than one set of genitals* (for some definition of "genitals").
